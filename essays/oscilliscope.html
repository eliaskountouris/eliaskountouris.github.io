		<h1>DIY Oscilliscope Project </h1>
		<h2>Build Log</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a functioning oscilliscope capable of measuring most signals in personal projects </li>
			<li>Keep it affordable (less than $150 CAD) </li>
			<li>Make it transportable (ideally one box, no setup required)  </li>
			<li>Learn about high frequency / mixed signal design  </li>
			<li>Attempt to implement   </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Pre-July 2023</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Researched basic theory of operation for an oscilliscope </li>
			<li>Selected ADC10065 as a potential ADC</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>July 3rd, 2023</h3>
		<h4>High Level Project Changes </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Decided to sacrifice transportability for this first prototype</li>
			<li>Will design analog front end arduino sheild board to handle signal input</li>
			<li>Will use PYNQ-Z2 PL to handle clock signals, buffering, and data output </li>
			<li>Will use PYNQ-Z2 PS to create python UI </li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Project Timeline </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The latest I can assemble the board by is ~Aug 15th, thus everything needs to have
				arrived by then. I'm assuming ~2 weeks for JLC order, so board should be ordered by July 31st.
			</li>
			<li>The bulk of verilog code can be written during that 2 week gap, but I will verify some 
				design assumptions this week in the lab. Mainly regarding the transmition of high frequency
				signals through the GPIO pins on the ardunio sheild.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>July 6th, 2023</h3>
		<h4>Evaluation of Signal Integrity </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Preliminary tests to determine highest frequency I could drive discrete signals through arduino sheild</li>
			<li>Struggled to get FPGA to output clock signals larger than 64 MHz</li>
			<li>Will need to return with proper verilog code setup to evaluate 100 MHz clocks, or clock splicing </li>
			<li>Discovered impact of 451Î© series resistance with prob to improve power transfer of signals, below are photos of the scope screen before and after adding the resistor:</li>
		</ul>
