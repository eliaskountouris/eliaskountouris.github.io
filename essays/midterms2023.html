		<h1>Midterms 2023 Post-Mortem </h1>
		<h2>A Reflection on my Study Methods and Productivity </h2>
		<h4>July 1st, 2023 </h4>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Context + Purpose</h3>
		<p>
			In Spring 2023 I took on 8 courses, a part-time job, and work with a student design team. 
			The was a part of a larger attempt to brute force the development of time management 
			by creating a daily swarm of externally enforced, mandatory, educational tasks. 
			Time blocking and daily schedules suggested this would be not just possible, but successful. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			What was success?
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The system induces time management / discipline in me </li>
			<li>The system is highly flexible and meshes with my unpredictable schedule </li>
			<li>The workload does not lead to burnout / does not force me to sacrifice my health</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Mideterm week was the first audit of this system. The stress test was 6 exams in one
			week + many smaller commitments. The exams directly measured my consistency (discipline)
			across the term, the smaller events evaluated the flexibility of the system, and my mental 
			sanity was an indicator of metric #3.
		</p>
		<p>
			What was the result of the audit? I had lower than anticipated marks, had to cancel
			several commitments, had to skip workouts and was overall very anxious throughout the week, 
			ie. fails across the board.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's easy to reflect on the results and say I simply took on too much, but that doesn't reflect 
			my day to day experience. Not once in the months prior to midterms did I feel that it was 
			"too much," given my copius amount of freetime. I also have a grudge against claiming it was
			"too much," as it places my physical capabilities far lower than what I'm satisfied with.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sitting here, a week later, I think my failure across midterm week was a combination of consistently 
			making small, yet poor, choices. In an attempt to learn from these, I will walk through some key
			decisions which come to mind, and hopefully create a strong gameplan of how to succeed in 
			university under a larger than expected workload.
		</p>
		<h3>The Months Prior </h3>
		<p>
			Perhaps the best way to analyze the 60ish days leading up to midterms is to average them out. 
			Most days follow some rough structure similiar to this: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Wake up around 8:00am </li>
			<li>Attend <i>some</i> lectures/labs (roughly 3 hours) </li>
			<li>Prepare / attend a job interview (roughly 2 hours) </li>
			<li>Do some homework (roughly 1 hour) </li>
			<li>Do some work for either my job or the design team (roughly 2 hours) </li>
			<li>Go to sleep around 12:00am </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This schedule is best charecterized by what is left out. The 8 hours of work per day, with a 
			large chunk devoted to job interviews, is not reflective of what my analysis of workload
		</p>
